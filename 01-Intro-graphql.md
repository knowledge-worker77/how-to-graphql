## What is GraphQL

GraphQL is a new way to create APIs that are more powerful, efficient, and flexible than REST. GraphQL is developed by Facebook and was open-sourced in 2015 and is now maintained by a large community of developers.

GraphQL allows declarative data fetching, clients specify what exactly they want from the server and GraphQL returns the required data, from a single endpoint instead of exposing multiple endpoints as a REST API would. 

Most people assume that GraphQL is a database technology, which is not correct. GraphQL is a query language for APIs. GraphQL doesn't have any specific requirements it can be used anywhere where an API is required.

## Alternative to REST

Before GraphQL, REST was the default way to expose data from a server because applications were simple and the development ecosystem wasn't that developed that much as it is today. 

But in the last couple of years, the API landscape has changed and is still changing rapidly.

Increased mobile usage, low-powered devices, and unstable networks are the main reasons Facebook created GraphQL. GraphQL minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and thus majorly improves applications operating under these conditions.

The heterogeneous landscape of front-end frameworks and platforms that run client applications makes it difficult to build and maintain one API that would fit the requirements of all. With GraphQL, each client can access precisely the data it needs.

More users mean more data being consumed, and each one of these users requires fast access to the data that they request from the server. GraphQL plays a vital role here because it only retrieves the specific data that each user requests.

## Better than REST

REST is the standard for designing web-APIs as it offers great tools such as stateless servers and a structured way to access resources.

But as the client requirements keep changing rapidly REST just can't keep up because of its inflexibility.

GraphQL was invented to keep up with the demand for a flexible and efficient way to access resources from a variety of clients, and it does the job it was created to do, that is to remove the shortcomings of REST.

- Protects clients from over-fetching and prevents under-fetching.
- Allows rapid iterations in the development cycle of APIs
- Can provide very basic insight analytics on how the APIs are being used.
- Provides a strong type and schema system
